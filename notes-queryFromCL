Login
    - mysql -u root -p

Create user, usually want to do this when creating a new DB, use the following command to create a new user
    - CREATE USER 'random'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';

To show all current users, run the following command after you log in
    - SELECT user, host FROM mysql.user;

Now that we have a created a user we need to grant it some privileges, run the following command 
    - GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON * . * TO 'random'@'localhost';

After granting privileges to a user, we need to clear the grants table using the following command
    - FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

To show user's current privileges, run
    - SHOW GRANTS FOR 'random'@'localhost';

Now we need to log out of mysql and log back in as created user, run
    - exit;
    - mysql -u random -p

Lets create a database, once logged in, run :
    - CREATE DATABASE test

To show databases for user, run
    - SHOW DATABASES;

Now we need to specify which db to use, run
    - USE test;

To create some tables we run
    - CREATE TABLE test-users(
        id INT AUTO_INCREMENT,
        first_name VARCHAR(100),
        last_name VARCHAR(100),
        email VARCHAR(75),
        password VARCHAR(250),
        location VARCHAR(100),
        dept VARCHAR(75),
        is_admin TINYINT(1),
        register_date DATETIME NOT NULL,
        PRIMARY KEY(id)
    );

AUTO_INCREMENT === auto create ids as the tables and rows are filled
VARCHAR === is a string
VARCHAR(#) === the number refers to the max char the field can contain, for VARCHAR the max total is 275
TINYINT === a boolean; 1 being true; 0 being false
DATETIME === just shows the time the user was created
PRIMARY KEY === sets the primary key for the table, () contain whatever value you want to make primary key
TEXT === any text, (#) has a limit of 65,000 characters

To show all tables in db run
    - SHOW TABLES

To drop a table run
    - DROP TABLE tablename

To delete a whole database
    - DROP DATABASE databasename
